Hi,

This is the code to verify that the total price 
for the items added to the amazon cart match the
expected price.

1. User searches for "hats for men" on amazon
2. Adds 2 to cart
3. The total price and quantity will be verified
4. Then user reduces the quantity from 2 to 1
5. The total price and quantity will be verified again
